				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>“<span epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Annajanska</span>” is frankly a bravura piece. The modern variety theatre demands for its “turns” little plays called sketches, to last twenty minutes or so, and to enable some favorite performer to make a brief but dazzling appearance on some barely passable dramatic pretext. Miss Lillah McCarthy and I, as author and actress, have helped to make one another famous on many serious occasions, from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Man and Superman</i> to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Androcles</i>; and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Charles Ricketts has not disdained to snatch moments from his painting and sculpture to design some wonderful dresses for us. We three unbent as <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Siddons, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Johnson might have unbent, to devise a “turn” for the Coliseum variety theatre. Not that we would set down the art of the variety theatre as something to be condescended to, or our own art as elephantine. We should rather crave indulgence as three novices fresh from the awful legitimacy of the highbrow theatre.</p>
				<p>Well, Miss McCarthy and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Ricketts justified themselves easily in the glamor of the footlights, to the strains of Tchaikovsky’s <i epub:type="se:name.music">1812</i>. I fear I did not. I have received only one compliment on my share; and that was from a friend who said, “It is the only one of your works that is not too long.” So I have made it a page or two longer, according to my own precept: <b>Embrace your reproaches: they are often glories in disguise</b>.</p>

				<p>The General’s office in a military station on the east front in Beotia. An office table with a telephone, writing materials, official papers, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, is set across the room. At the end of the table, a comfortable chair for the General. Behind the chair, a window. Facing it at the other end of the table, a plain wooden bench. At the side of the table, with its back to the door, a common chair, with a typewriter before it. Beside the door, which is opposite the end of the bench, a rack for caps and coats. There is nobody in the room.</p>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">General Strammfest</b> enters, followed by <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lieutenant Schneidekind</b>.

							<td>You are young, young and heartless. You are excited by the revolution: you are attached to abstract things like liberty. But my family has served the Panjandrums of Beotia faithfully for seven centuries. The Panjandrums have kept our place for us at their courts, honored us, promoted us, shed their glory on us, made us what we are. When I hear you young men declaring that you are fighting for civilization, for democracy, for the overthrow of militarism, I ask myself how can a man shed his blood for empty words used by vulgar tradesmen and common laborers: mere wind and stink. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">He rises, exalted by his theme.</i> A king is a splendid reality, a man raised above us like a god. You can see him; you can kiss his hand; you can be cheered by his smile and terrified by his frown. I would have died for my Panjandrum as my father died for his father. Your toiling millions were only too honored to receive the toes of our boots in the proper spot for them when they displeased their betters. And now what is left in life for me? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">He relapses into his chair discouraged.</i> My Panjandrum is deposed and transported to herd with convicts. The army, his pride and glory, is paraded to hear seditious speeches from penniless rebels, with the colonel actually forced to take the chair and introduce the speaker. I myself am made Commander-in-Chief by my own solicitor: a Jew, Schneidekind! a Hebrew Jew! It seems only yesterday that these things would have been the ravings of a madman: today they are the commonplaces of the gutter press. I live now for three objects only: to defeat the enemy, to restore the Panjandrum, and to hang my solicitor.</td>
