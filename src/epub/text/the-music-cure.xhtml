				<p>This is not a serious play: it is what is called a Variety Turn for two musicians. It is written for two pianists, but can be adapted to any instruments on which the performers happen to be proficient. At its first performance by Miss Madge McIntosh and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William Armstrong the difficulty arose that, though <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Armstrong was an accomplished pianist, Miss McIntosh’s virtuosity was confined to the English concertina. That did just as well.</p>
				<p>As a last desperate resort a pianola behind the scenes can be employed; but the result will lack spontaneity.</p>
				<p>There is, however, no pressing reason why the thing should be performed at all.</p>

				<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lord Reginald Fitzambry</b>, a fashionably dressed, rather pretty young man of 22, is prostrate on a sofa in a large hotel drawing room, crying convulsively. His <b epub:type="z3998:persona">doctor</b> is trying to soothe him. The <b epub:type="z3998:persona">doctor</b> is about a dozen years his senior; and his ways are the ways of a still youthful man who considers himself in smart society as well as professionally attendant on it. The drawing room has tall central doors, at present locked. If anyone could enter under these circumstances, he would find on his left a grand piano with the keyboard end towards him, and a smaller door beyond the piano. On his right would be the window, and, further on, the sofa on which the unhappy youth is wallowing, with, close by it, the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">doctor’s</b> chair and a little table accommodating the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">doctor’s</b> hat, a plate, a medicine bottle, a half emptied glass, and a bell call.</p>

It wasn’t disgraceful: it was simple common sense. I’m not a financier; but you can’t persuade me that if you happen to know that certain shares are going to rise you shouldn’t buy them.
