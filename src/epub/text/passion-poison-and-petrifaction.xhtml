				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>This tragedy was written at the request of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cyril Maude, under whose direction it was performed repeatedly, with colossal success, in a booth in Regent’s Park, for the benefit of The Actors’ Orphanage, on the 14th July 1905, by Miss Irene Vanbrugh, Miss Nancy Price, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G. P.</abbr> Huntley, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cyril Maude, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Eric Lewis, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Arthur Williams, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lennox Pawle.</p>
				<p>As it is extremely difficult to find an actor capable of eating a real ceiling, it will be found convenient in performance to substitute the tops of old wedding cakes for bits of plaster. There is but little difference in material between the two substances; but the taste of the wedding cake is considered more agreeable by many people.</p>
				<p>The orchestra should consist of at least a harp, a drum, and a pair of cymbals, these instruments being the most useful in enhancing the stage effect.</p>
				<p>The landlord may with equal propriety be a landlady, if that arrangement be better suited to the resources of the company.</p>
				<p>As the “Bill Bailey” song has not proved immortal, any equally appropriate ditty of the moment may be substituted.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Passion, Poison and Petrifaction</h3>
				<p>In a bed-sitting room in a fashionable quarter of London a <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lady</b> sits at her dressing table, with her maid combing her hair. It is late; and the electric lamps are glowing. Apparently the room is bedless; but there stands against the opposite wall to that at which the dressing table is placed a piece of furniture that suggests a bookcase without carrying conviction. On the same side is a chest of drawers of that disastrous kind which, recalcitrant to the opener until she is provoked to violence, then suddenly come wholly out and defy all her efforts to fit them in again. Opposite this chest of drawers, on the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lady’s</b> side of the room, is a cupboard. The presence of a row of gentleman’s boots beside the chest of drawers proclaims that the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lady</b> is married. Her own boots are beside the cupboard. The third wall is pierced midway by the door, above which is a cuckoo clock. Near the door a pedestal bears a portrait bust of the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lady</b> in plaster. There is a fan on the dressing table, a hatbox and rug strap on the chest of drawers, an umbrella and a bootjack against the wall near the bed. The general impression is one of brightness, beauty, and social ambition, damped by somewhat inadequate means. A certain air of theatricality is produced by the fact that though the room is rectangular it has only three walls. Not a sound is heard except the overture and the crackling of the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Lady’s</b> hair as the maid’s brush draws electric sparks from it in the dry air of the London midsummer.</p>

They sing “Bill Bailey” so sweetly that she can attend to nothing else, and forgets to remove even her boots as she draws the coverlet over herself and sinks to sleep, lulled by celestial harmony. A white radiance plays on her pillow, and lights up her beautiful face. But the thunder growls again; and a lurid red glow concentrates itself on the door, which is presently flung open, revealing a saturnine figure in evening dress, partially concealed by a crimson cloak. As he steals towards the bed the unnatural glare in his eyes and the broad-bladed dagger nervously gripped in his right hand bode ill for the sleeping lady. Providentially she sneezes on the very brink of eternity; and the tension of the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Murderer’s</b> nerves is such that he bolts precipitately under the bed at the sudden and startling <em>Atscha!</em> A dull, heavy, rhythmic thumping⁠—the beating of his heart⁠—betrays his whereabouts.

							<td>I have something far better than any lozenge: the devotion of a lifetime. Formerly it was George’s. I kept his house, or rather, his lodgings. I mended his clothes. I darned his socks. I bought his food. I interviewed his creditors. I stood between him and the servants. I administered his domestic finances. When his hair needed cutting or his countenance was imperfectly washed, I pointed it out to him. The trouble that all this gave me made him prosaic in my eyes. Familiarity bred contempt. Now all that shall end. My husband shall be my hero, my lover, my perfect knight. He shall shield me from all care and trouble. He shall ask nothing in return but love⁠—boundless, priceless, rapturous, soul-enthralling love, <strong>Love! Love!! Love!!!</strong> <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">She raves and flings her arms about <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Fitz</b>.</i> And the duties I formerly discharged shall be replaced by the one supreme duty of duties: the duty of weeping at Adolphus’s tomb.</td>
