If he <em>did</em>⁠—! Well, what I want to say is⁠—of course I am saying it very badly because I never could speak in public; but the fact is, neither can Cyril. Excuse my calling him Cyril; I know I should speak of him as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Maude, but⁠—but⁠—perhaps I had better explain that we are married; and the force of habit is so strong⁠—er⁠—yes, isn’t it? You see, it’s like this. At least, what I wanted to say is⁠—is⁠—is⁠—er⁠—. A little applause would encourage me perhaps, if you don’t mind. Thank you. Of course, it’s so ridiculous to be nervous like this, among friends, isn’t it? But I have had such a dreadful week at home over this speech of Cyril’s. He gets so angry with me when I tell him that he can’t make speeches, and that nobody wants him to make one! I only wanted to encourage him; but he is <em>so</em> irritable when he has to build a theatre! Of course, you wouldn’t think so, seeing him act, but you don’t know what he is at home. Well, dear ladies and gentlemen, will you be very nice and kind to him when he is speaking, and if he is nervous, don’t notice it? And please don’t make any noise; the least sound upsets him and puts his speech out of his head. It is really a very good speech; he has not let me see the manuscript, and he thinks I know nothing about it, but I have heard him make it four times in his sleep. He does it very well when he is asleep⁠—quite like an orator; but unfortunately he is awake now and in a fearful state of nerves. I felt I must come out and ask you to be kind to him⁠—after all, we are old friends, aren’t we? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Applause.</i> Oh, thank you, thank you; that is your promise to me to be kind to him. Now I will run away. Please don’t tell him I dared to do this. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Going.</i> And, please, please, not the least noise. If a hairpin drops, all is lost. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Coming back to centre.</i> Oh, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Conductor, would you be so good, when he comes to the pathetic part, to give him a little slow music?

Look at the Royal Institution, the Statistical Society, the House of Commons! Are we less scholarly, less cultured, less serious than the audiences there? I say nothing of my own humble powers, but <em>am</em> I less entertaining than an average Cabinet Minister?

You see, what my husband and I have been trying to do is a very difficult thing. We have some friends here⁠—some old and valued friends⁠—some young ones, too, we hope, but we also have for the first time in this house of ours the great public. We dare not call ourselves the friends of the public. We are only its servants and like all servants we are very much afraid of seeming disrespectful if we allow ourselves to be too familiar, and we are most at our ease when we are doing our work. We rather dread occasions like these, when we are allowed, and even expected, to step out of our place, and speak in our own persons of our own affairs⁠—even for a moment, perhaps, <em>very</em> discreetly, of our own feelings. Well, what can we do? We recite a little verse; we make a little speech; we are shy; in the end we put ourselves out of countenance, put you out of countenance, and strain your attitude of kindness and welcome until it becomes an attitude of wishing that it was all over. Well, we resolved not to do that tonight if we could help it. After all, you know how glad we are to see you, for you have the advantage of us: you can do without us; we cannot do without you. I will not say that</p>

And now may I run away and tell Cyril that his speech has been a great success after all, and that you are quite ready for <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Toddles</i>? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Assent and applause.</i> Thank you. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></p>
