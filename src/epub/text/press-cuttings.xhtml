				<p>By direction of the Lord Chamberlain the General and the Prime Minister in this play must in all public performances of it be addressed and described as General Bones and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Johnson, and by no means as General Mitchener and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balsquith. The allusions to commoner persons are allowed to stand as they are.</p>
				<p>General Mitchener, by the way, is not the late Lord Kitchener, but an earlier and more highly connected commander. Balsquith (Balfour-Asquith) is obviously neither of these statesmen, and cannot in the course of nature be both.</p>

				<p>The forenoon of the first of April, 1911.</p>
				<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">General Mitchener</b> is at his writing table in the War Office, opening letters. On his left is the fireplace, with a fire burning. On his right, against the opposite wall, is a standing desk with an office stool. The door is in the wall behind him, halfway between the table and the desk. The table is not quite in the middle of the room: it is nearer to the hearthrug than to the desk. There is a chair at each end of it for persons having business with the <b epub:type="z3998:persona">General</b>. There is a telephone on the table.</p>
				<p>Long silence.</p>

The Salic Law, which forbade women to occupy a throne, is founded on the fact that when a woman is on the throne the country is ruled by men, and therefore ruled badly; whereas when a man is on the throne, the country is ruled by women, and therefore ruled well. The suffragettes would degrade women from being rulers to being voters, mere politicians, the drudges of the caucus and the polling booth. We should lose our influence completely under such a state of affairs. The New Zealand women have the vote. What is the result? No poet ever makes a New Zealand woman his heroine.
